#### ABOUT THE PLUGIN

A simple workshop map changer with a 45-minute timer. An ideal plugin for Surf, KZ, Jump servers.
I couldn't find a functional workshop map changer anywhere, so I was forced to create one for my own needs. This is my first plugin, and I will definitely be planning updates. If you find any bugs, please report them to me privately via Discord message.
